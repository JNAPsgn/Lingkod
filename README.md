# Lingkod: "The Analysis of Exam Performance by Students"

## INTRODUCTION


## STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM
Today, Teachers measure students’ obtained knowledge progress through assessment and evaluation, yet course grades are heavily weighted by examination scores. Students are pressured to perform well under these conditions in order to graduate. Studying is employed in response to this to achieve high examination scores. Exam formats and student study strategies are widely varied. Yet, researchers have not determined whether specific study strategies are engaged in response to a given exam format. Therefore, this alternate plan paper will focus primarily on previous research studies that have concentrated on collecting information of the student performance or progress, and usage of the cramming study strategy amongst students’ population. Assessment and evaluating format identify the student’s issues as well as their program flaws and preferences, assessment and evaluating performance study strategy approaches and influences will be explained throughout the comprehensive literature review. The review concludes with a summary of the existing research followed by future research recommendations.


## SIGNIFICANCE OF THE PROJECT
Assessment and evaluation are critical tools for tailoring curriculum and instructional techniques to the needs of students, as well as measuring the overall efficacy of programs and classroom activities.The information acquired via assessments and evaluations assists teachers in identifying students' issues as well as program flaws.

The process of analyzing the quality of student work against set standards and providing a value to indicate that quality is referred to as evaluation.
The goal of assessment is to collect useful information on student performance or progress, or to establish student interests in order to make decisions regarding their learning process. Assessment data assists teachers in determining students' strengths and shortcomings, as well as their general grasp of course material. An evaluation assists educators in adjusting their teaching approaches to ensure the maximum amount of effective learning for each student.  The information acquired via assessments and evaluations assists teachers in identifying students' issues as well as program flaws.Teachers offer detailed feedback to students as part of the evaluation process to direct their efforts toward development.
